# Image Classification Web Application

This project is a web-based application that combines deep learning with a user-friendly interface for image classification tasks. It utilizes PyTorch for the machine learning backend and Flask for the web server implementation.

## Features

- Web-based interface for image classification
- Deep learning model based on PyTorch
- Interactive visualization of results
- Model interpretability using LIME
- Efficient image processing pipeline

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Flask
- Other dependencies as listed in `requirement.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Flask application file containing the web server implementation
- `model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with model training code and analysis
- `trained_model.pth`: Pre-trained PyTorch model
- `static/`: Directory containing static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images)
- `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates
- `requirement.txt`: List of Python dependencies

## Usage

1. Start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

3. Upload an image through the web interface to get classification results

## Model Information

 The model architecture is based on EfficientNet and has been fine-tuned for specific classification tasks.
